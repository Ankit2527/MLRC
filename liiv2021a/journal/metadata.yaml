abstract: "We investigate the claims made in Ensemble Distribution Distillation by reproducing the original experiments performed by the authors. Our findings generally support the claims, although we do not observe the same poor performance of the EnD baseline model. We also provide a novel visualization of the uncertainty estimation behavior of the ensemble and corresponding distilled model."
