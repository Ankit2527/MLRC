# Don't forget to surround abstract with double quotes
abstract: "The motivating premise behind Neural Networks Fail to Learn Periodic Functions and How to Fix It is that the standard activation functions fail to learn how to extrapolate periodic functions. This claim is demonstrated experimentally, and it is hypothesized that it is due to their lack of “periodic” inductive bias. A solution to this problem is proposed in the form of a novel activation function which is named the snake activation. Its advantages over ReLU, tanh, and sigmoid are demonstrated on temperature and financial data prediction problems. We exhaustively replicate the list of original experiments, confirming the claims of the original paper. We also investigate whether the snake activation can be adopted for more widespread use cases, analyzing its performance when used in GANs and LSTMs."
