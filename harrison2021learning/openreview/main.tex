\title{ML Reproducibility Challenge 2020 \\ Learning to Deceive With Attention-Based Explanations}

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

% Anonymization due to guidelines of MLRC challenge
% \author{
%     Anonymous Author(s)\\
%     Affiliation\\
%     Email
