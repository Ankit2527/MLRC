# Don't forget to surround abstract with double quotes
abstract: "Pruthi et al. (2020) experimentally show that attention-based explanations can be manipulated, by adding a model-agnostic penalty term to the loss function that penalises the model for attending to certain tokens which have been shown to be crucial for high performance (termed impermissible tokens). Despite this penalty resulting in substantial reductions of attention masses of impermissible tokens, the authors find that models still use these tokens as evidenced by no observed drop in accuracy. Given the implications of their findings for the use of attention-based explanations, we seek to reproduce their core results, while replicating others including their BERT-based model. We manage to both successfully reproduce and replicate the majority of their findings, providing further evidence to the claims in the original paper."
