abstract: "This report covers our reproduction of the paper Explaining Low dimensional Representation by Plumb et al. In this paper, a method (Transitive Global Translations, TGT) is proposed for explaining different clusters in low dimensional representations of high dimensional data. They show their method outperforms the Difference Between the Means (DBM) method, is consistent in explaining differences with few features and matches real patterns in data. We verify these claims by reproducing their experiments and testing their method on new data. We also investigate the use of more complex transformations to explain differences between clusters."
