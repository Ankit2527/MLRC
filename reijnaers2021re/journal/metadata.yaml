# Don't forget to surround abstract with double quotes
abstract: "In this paper we present an analysis and elaboration of (Plumb et 
           al., 2020), in which an algorithm is posed for the purpose of 
           finding human-understandable explanations in terms of given 
           explainable features of input data for differences between groups
           of points occurring in a lower-dimensional representation of that
           input data. We have upgraded the original code provided by the
           author such that it is compatible with recent versions of popular
           deep learning frameworks, namely the TensorFlow 2.x- and PyTorch
           1.7.x-libraries. Furthermore, we have created our own implementation
           of the algorithm in which we have incorporated additional
           experiments in order to evaluate the algorithm’s relevance in the
           scope of different dimensionality reduction techniques and
           differently structured data. We have performed the same experiments
           as described in the original paper using both the upgraded version
           of the code provided by the author and our own implementation taking
           the authors' code and paper as references. The results presented in 
           the original paper were reproducible, both by using the provided
           code and our own implementation. Our additional experiments have
           highlighted several limitations of the explanatory algorithm in
           question: the algorithm severely relies on the shape and variance of
           the clusters present in the data (and, if applicable, the method
           used to label these clusters), and highly non-linear dimensionality
           reduction algorithms perform worse in terms of explainability. The 
           authors have provided an implementation that cleanly separates
           different experiments on different datasets and the core functional
           methodology. As a result of this separation, given a working
           environment, one could easily reproduce the experiments performed
           in the original paper. Minor difficulties were experienced in
           setting up the required environment for running the code provided
           by Plumb et al. locally (i.e. trivial changes in the code such as
           the usage of absolute paths and obtaining external dependencies).
           Evidently, it was time-consuming to rewrite all corresponding code,
           including the architecture for the variational auto-encoder provided
           by an external package, scvis 0.1.0. No communication with the
           original authors was required to reproduce their work."
