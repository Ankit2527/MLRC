% Please note that increased TeX memory size is required to compile this
% document, because of the heavy PGF figures in the appendix. This can be
% easily done by updating texlive/2021/texf.cnf and running fmtutil-sys --all.
% We have opted for this approach as alternatives (creating stand-alone
% figures, externalizing using tikz or custom-made scripts) could pose errors
% in other environments. However, if the increased memory size is a problem,
% please follow the following instructions:
%
% 1. Enter the 'openreview' folder
% 2. Open 'appendices.tex'
% 3. Replace all '/latent_spaces/original/' by '/latent_spaces/compressed/'
%
% Compiling the compressed figures should work in any environment. If, unexpectedly, memory is still short, we have included a /highly_compressed/ folder as well.
